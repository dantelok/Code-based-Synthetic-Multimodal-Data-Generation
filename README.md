# Code-based-Synthetic-Multimodal-Data-Generation

### What is the question we want to answer?
We want to develop an approach and a pipeline for generating synthetic multimodal data in order to train, enhance, and evaluate multimodal models such as Visual Language Models (VLMs).

### Why is this question important?
High-quality, diverse datasets are essential for improving VLMsâ€™ understanding of both textual and visual information.
Existing multimodal datasets lack structured chart/plot-based data. This limits their visualization understanding.
Synthetic data generation enables us to create a diverse dataset scalably while reducing costs and biases.
